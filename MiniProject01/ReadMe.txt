Miniproject 1: Multiple censors and outputs
Code is based on gpio-test-int.c by RidgeRun

== Pins and Settings ==
=== Inputs ===
Temperature censor (I2C)
	SCL: Pin 19 (I2C2_SCL)
	SDA: Pin 20 (I2C2_SDA)

Potentiometer (analog)
	VDD: Pin 32 (VDD_ADC(1.8V))
	GND: Pin 34 (GNDA_ADC)
	Input: Pin 36 (AIN5)

Square wave from function generator (GPIO)
	HiLevel 1.8 V
	LowLevel 0 V
	~1 kHz, can vary
	Input: Pin 12 (GPIO1_28)

=== Outputs ===
Interrupt LED:
	Pin 42 (GPIO_7)

Multi-colored LED:
	Red: Pin 15 (GPIO1_16)
	Blue: Pin 23 (GPIO1_17)

== Usage ==
1. An interrupt is triggered on each pulse of the square wave generated by the function generator.
	The frequency can be adjusted to change how often the program responds.
	On each interrupt, the current temperature in Fahrenheit and potentiometer value is printed.
2. The interrupt LED blinks each time an interrupt occurs. Change the square wave frequency to alter the
	speed of this LED (gpio output).
3. The temperature is read from our censor on each interrupt and converted to Fahrenheit.
4. A potentiometer is also read and the value is given from 0 to 4096.
5. On a ^C interrupt, the program shuts down.

A multi-colored LED is used to provide visual feedback. If the potentiometer value is between 2000 and
3000, this LED blinks blue. If the temperature censor reads greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit, 
the LED blinks red. If neither case is met, the LED is not illuminated.
